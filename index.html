      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Professional Life</h2>
      <p>My name is Kerri Rentmeester. After 16 years of teaching highschool Spanish and English Language Learners (ELL), I am transitioning to a career in Tech. I am a creative collaborator who enjoys leadership positions and communicating with people.<br><br></p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid" id="content2Container">
      <p>After graduating with a 3.9 GPA in Information Science and Technology from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in May of 2022, I accepted a contract position as a technical writer at a large manufacturing company, where I currently work. American Foods Group, located in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is home of the largest beef producing plant in North America. In collaboration with the core team on Project Vision, a multiple year process of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Plan (ERP), I employ strong attention to detail and organizational skills. I write the training documentation for functional areas of business for the ERP software system (Infor M3), enterprise wide. A number of business processes, for example “entering a customer order,” need specific documentation laid out for users once the system is live. Working with SMEs to analyze what series of tasks need to be described, I create easy to read documentation as an instructional guide including step-by-step instructions with images for the end-user to follow upon training and go-live. <br><br>

        <p class="card-text">I continue to challenge myself by diving deeper into software development. To advance my skills beyond what I learned at UW-Milwaukee (Python, PHP, SQL, etc.) I started a coding bootcamp and am currently attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding Full Stack Development with MERN. By course completion, I will have employed the following technologies and concepts:  GitHub, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, React, JSX, ExpressJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, API’s, DevOps and Testing, etc. <br></p>

      <h3>As a teacher I melded collaboration with self-directed work, and grew my leadership skills. </h3>
          <p>I ended my teaching career working at a small, rural, 4K-12 school, where I found myself as the lone highschool Spanish teacher as well as the only ESL teacher in the district. (Fun Fact: Until a renovation in 2020, Sevastopol School in Sturgeon Bay was Wisconsin's oldest K-12 building in the state!) I worked in one small, rural school in an area of many small, rural schools, so the teachers at the six surrounding school districts formed a cohort of Spanish and ELL teachers in which we met quarterly to join forces. We exchanged ideas, crafted unit and lesson plans together, and created regularly occurring self-guided professional development opportunities. Some of my favorite moments in teaching were from collaborating with colleagues because I became a better teacher by borrowing and learning from my talented peers. From this cohort, https://www.llamaalapuerta.com/ was born. Another teacher and I developed and maintained this, now defunct, website for our highschool Spanish students to have a place to publish their writing and interact with their peers within the broader community. We wanted our students to share and collaborate in the same way we were able to collaborate. The experience was incredibly rewarding. <br><br> I honed my self-discipline and self sufficiency by creating the curriculum for both the Spanish and ELL courses I taught. I put my previous seven years of teaching and travel experience to work when I arrived at Sevastopol. Being incredibly appreciative of the freedom and trust I was given to cultivate the units, lessons, assessments, and experiences for my students to grow was a rewarding creative outlet for me. This incredible gift fed my unquenchable appetite for continually adapting the curriculum as my professional knowledge grew. I am highly motivated to continually learn and that is why "doing the work" comes easy to me. <br><br> Being a veteran teacher, I took on leadership roles as well. In my role as the district's ELL teacher, in an environment where not many truly understood the impact they could have in a non-native English speaker's life, I taught teachers how to teach their content area whether the student knew only a few words or had the capacity to express him/herself in full sentences. I led professional development seminars, as well as, spent time one-on-one with my colleagues helping them alter their lessons, assessments, and expectations so that their ESL students could grow their skills, learn, and feel successful. I pushed for our district to take on co-teaching, in which another teacher and I would teach alongside each other in her content area. We created lessons together, graded together, taught together, laughed together, cried together! and felt successes with each other. We had a powerful impact on students' lives and the benefit of the experience my co-teacher received had a career lasting impact on her teaching going forward. I learned a great deal likewise because I was paired with an amazing veteran teacher who impressed me daily with her skills.

    <div class="container-fluid" id="content5Container">
      <p>My goal is to continually increase my proficiency in coding so that I can add value to a company. Like in my teaching career, I expect to spend the first years learning and growing in an environment that treasures training, support, and collaboration. Eventually, I will arrive at a point where I can share the expertise I developed, collaborate, and become a leader. I seek a company that fosters a culture of community and encourages growth and furthering education in its employees in a collaborative environment.
